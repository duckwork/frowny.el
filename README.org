/For alphapapa, so he can insert frownies with electric-pair-mode./

This package ships `frowny-mode', which enables inserting a single "("
when after a ":" -- meaning it'll insert :( without closing the
parentheses for modes like =electric-pair-mode=, =paredit-mode=, and
others.

* Version 0.3

2021-11-07: Add =frowny-inhibit-modes=, so I can toggle
=hide-details-mode= in dired.

* Version 0.2

Version 0.2, /now with smileys/!  Yes, if you're one of those
happy-go-lucky people who just /has/ to smile all the time, frowny.el is
now for you as well.  Go nuts, ya filthy animal.

* Installation

I use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]], which looks like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (straight-use-package '(frowny
                          :host github
                          :repo "duckwork/frowny.el"))
#+end_src

You might need a different form.

* Use

Simple as adding it to whatever modes you don't want to always insert
electric pairs, e.g.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'erc-mode-hook #'frowny-mode)
#+end_src

Or you can enable =global-frowny-mode=, which enables frowny in every
buffer.  If you want to enable =global-frowny-mode= but only for some
modes, customize =frowny-modes=.

* Customization

There are a (growing?) number of customization options available for
=frowny-mode=:

- =frowny-eyes= :: the regex to look for when seeing if =(= is completing
  a frowny.  Default: =\\(?::-\\|[:=]\\)=, which captures frownies like
  =:(=, =:-(=, and ==(=.  I'd recommend replacing it with an =rx= form, like
  this:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq frowny-eyes (rx (or ":" ":-" "=" ":'-")))
  #+end_src

- =frowny-eyes-looking-back-limit= :: =frowny= uses =looking-back= to
  determine whether the =(= you type is part of a frowny.  Emacs's
  manual recommends limiting the number of characters =looking-back=
  searches for performance reasons, so I recommend setting this number
  to the maximum length of the strings you have as options in
  =frowny-eyes=.  As such, the default is 2.
- =frowny-modes= :: When enabling =global-frowny-mode=, you might not want
  frowny to apply to every buffer.  Add modes to this list to only
  apply frowny to them.  By default, frowny applies to every mode.
- =frowny-inhibit-modes= :: A list of modes in which to /inhibit/ frowny
  mode.  By default, only =special-mode= is inhibited.  I also add
  =dired-mode= in my configuration.

Of course, you can always customize these options using Emacs's Customize functionality.

* Still to do

- I should probably make =frowny-modes= more ... complex, and allow
  specifying modes /not/ to apply frowny to.
- I could do a =frowny-prog-mode= that checks whether the point is in a
  comment or not, and frowny accordingly.
